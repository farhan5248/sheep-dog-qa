    "response": "{ \"The sky appears blue to us during the day due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. This occurs when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere and interacts with the tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). The shorter, blue wavelengths are scattered more than the longer, red wavelengths because they have a smaller wavelength and are more easily deflected by these gas molecules.\": \"Rayleigh scattering is responsible for the blue color we see in the sky during the day.} } The blue light that reaches our eyes from the sky is not actually coming from the sky itself, but rather from the sunlight that is passing through the atmosphere. So while it might seem like the sky is emitting blue light, it's actually just reflecting and scattering the light that's already present in the air.\"}",
