= Test-Suite: Create Documentation

@sheep-dog-test

These four tests describe the Eclipse IDE features that can be customised.
1. Error validation
2. Content proposal
3. Quick fixes
4. Code generation

== Test-Case: Start a step without the component specified

Start with single step and trigger an error by not specifying a component.

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                   
| The Input file is present                   
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, validate error action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Step
| 1            
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin, validate error dialog will be set as follows
+
|===
| Message                             
| The first step must have a component
|===

== Test-Case: Select from list of existing objects in the component

Now that there's a component, select from a list of its existing objects.

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                
| The daily batchjob,                      
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present          
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, propose test step action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin, propose content dialog will be set as follows
+
|===
| Suggestion     | Suggestion Name
| The Input file | Input file     
|===

== Test-Case: Confirm that this is a new step definition

Create a new step instead of picking from what exists and ignore the warning.

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                
| The daily batchjob, Input file is present
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is absent           
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, validate warning action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin, validate warning dialog will be set as follows
+
|===
| Message                                                      
| is present doesn't exist in daily batchjob/Input file.feature
|===

== Test-Case: Create the new step definition

Use the suggested quick fix to add this new step to the step object file.

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                
| The daily batchjob, Input file is present
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is absent           
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, generate step definition action is performed

* Then: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file will be created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present          
|===
