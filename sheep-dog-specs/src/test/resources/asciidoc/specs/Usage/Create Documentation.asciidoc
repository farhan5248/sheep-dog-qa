= Test-Suite: Create Documentation

@sheep-dog-test

These four tests describe the Eclipse IDE features that can be customised.

1. Error validation
2. Content proposal
3. Quick fixes
4. Code generation

== Test-Case: Start a step without the component specified

Start with single step and trigger an error by not specifying a component.

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                
| The Input file is present
|===

* When: The xtext plugin validate action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1 
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin validate dialog will be set as follows
+
----
The first step must have a component
----

== Test-Case: Confirm that this is a new step definition

Create a new step instead of picking from what exists and ignore the warning.

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                               
| The daily batchjob Input file is present
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is absent           
|===

* When: The xtext plugin validate action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1 
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin validate dialog will be set as follows
+
----
The step definition doesn't exist for the step object
----

== Test-Case: Create the new step definition

Use the suggested quick fix to add this new step to the step object file.

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                               
| The daily batchjob Input file is present
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is absent           
|===

* When: The xtext plugin generate step definition action is performed

* Then: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file will be created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present          
|===
