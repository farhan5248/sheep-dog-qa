= Test-Suite: Proposals for Step Objects from Previous Steps

@sheep-dog-test

TODO Add more background tests

The general idea behind these tests is that when no object is specified in the test step, you get a list of proposals.
The variables are:

1. Component: There's no suggestions if there's no component.
2. Component Object: If there's a component, propose objects that it has.
3. Previous Object in Test Case: If there's a previous object, propose both just the name and the long form name
4. Test Setup: The test setup section is checked if it has a component or object specified.

== Test-Case: No component no existing
