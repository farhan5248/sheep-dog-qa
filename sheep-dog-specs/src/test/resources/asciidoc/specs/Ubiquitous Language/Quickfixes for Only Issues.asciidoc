----
Every test case must have at least one component specified.
This should be the first part of the test step name.
The component is optional.
Component ending words are: application, service, plugin, batchjob, project.
Examples are: "The something application," or "The something service,"Every test step must have the object specified.
The object can have the complete path or not.

----
After specifying the step object name, a step definition name is specified.
It has 3 parts, details (optional), state and time (optional).
Details is used to specify a part in a document, like the header or body.
The details ending words are: section, fragment, table, snippet, list.
