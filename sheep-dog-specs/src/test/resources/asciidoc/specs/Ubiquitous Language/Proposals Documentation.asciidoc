Just as you can see the associated Javadoc for classes and attributes, you can attach documentation about the objects and step-definitions.

== Test-Case: Display non-existing object references

@Suggest

If an object is mentioned in a test step but isn't created in the stepdefs folder yet, it can still be used.
In that case, the tooltip displays the line that the object is on.

== Test-Case: Display existing object references

@Suggest

If the fully qualified name of an object is specified, then its documentation is displayed.
If it's a reference to an object in a previous step, the referred object name is displayed.
This is done because it was useful to know to which step the object is implicitly pointing to.

TODO I guess I could put the full name and the documentation if it exists.
