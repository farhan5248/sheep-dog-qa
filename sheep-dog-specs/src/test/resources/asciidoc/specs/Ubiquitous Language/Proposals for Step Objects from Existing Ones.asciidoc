= Test-Suite: Proposals for Step Objects from Existing Ones

@sheep-dog-test

TODO Collapse all these tests into fewer ones using Test Data

The general idea behind these tests is that when no object is specified in the test step, you get a list of proposals.
The variables are:

1. Component: There's no suggestions if there's no component.
2. Component Object: If there's a component, propose objects that it has.
3. Previous Object in Test Case: If there's a previous object with the fully qualified name, then only the name is suggested
4. Test Setup: The test setup section is checked if it has a component or object specified.

== Test-Case: No component no existing
