= Test-Suite: Problems Which Prevent Code Generation

@sheep-dog-test

Some problems prevent code generation. 
For example not knowing which component an object belongs to gets in the way of knowing where to create the file.

== Test-Case: The first step needs to have a component specified

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                
| The daily batchjob, Input file is present
| The Input file is downloaded             
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, validate error action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Step
| 1            
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin, validate error dialog will be empty

== Test-Case: No component in the first step triggers an error

The first step needs to have a component specified.
The other steps default to that one.

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows

| Step Name                                   
| The Input file is present                   
| The daily batchjob, Input file is downloaded

* When: The xtext plugin, validate error action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Step
| 1            
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin, validate error dialog will be set as follows
