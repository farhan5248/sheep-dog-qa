= Test-Suite: Code Generation

@sheep-dog-test

The Xtext framework lets you map the DSL to Java so that you can generate the Java code with minimal coding.
I think that’s useful for a tester if every component is written in Java or the same language.
If it’s not, and there’s PL/SQL, COBOL, webMethods, Layer 7 and other such languages, you might not need Java code but insert statements for example.
In that case, generating Java code isn’t that useful so I generate the lower layer describing each object.
One way to see these two layers is that the test cases in the first layer are paths in a graph model and the steps in the second are the vertices.

There's 3 things to generate
1. An object such as an input file or report, a web-page or web-service response etc.
2. A keyword or statement aka step definition about that object such as whether is exists, or has certain attributes or fields.
3. A combination of parameters for that statement. This could be different combinations of search fields used in a search page.

== Test-Case: Create a new object for a component

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                
| The daily batchjob, Input file is present
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, generate step definition action is performed

* Then: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file will be created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present          
|===

== Test-Case: Create a step definition for an object

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                
| The daily batchjob, Input file is present
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is absent           
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, generate step definition action is performed

* Then: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file will be created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present          
|===

== Test-Case: Create a new parameter set for the step-definition

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                 | Headers   
| The daily batchjob, Input file is present | New Header
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name | Parameters
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present           | Old Header
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, generate step definition action is performed

* Then: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file will be created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name | Parameters
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present           | New Header
|===
