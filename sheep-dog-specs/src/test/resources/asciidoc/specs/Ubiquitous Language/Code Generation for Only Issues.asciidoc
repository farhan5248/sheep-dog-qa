@sheep-dog-test

These tests verify that code generation works correctly when names follow proper capitalization rules.

== Test-Case: Cell name should start with a capital letter generation

@Generate

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                | Row Contents
| The daily batchjob Input file is present | lowercase header
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name | Parameters
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present           | lowercase header
|===

* And: The xtext plugin list quickfixes dialog is set as follows
+
|===
| Quickfix Name        | Quickfix Description                    | Quickfix
| Capitalize cell name | Capitalize the first letter of the name | Lowercase header
|===

* When: The xtext plugin apply quickfix action is performed as follows

|===
| Selected Element
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1/Table/Row/1/Cell/1
|===

* Then: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file will be created as follows
