= Test-Suite: Quickfixes for Workspace Issues

@sheep-dog-test

Some problems are fixed by code generation.
They're typically things like keywords or objects that are not defined in the step objects layer.
I could just ignore all those warnings and then use the Build Project menu item and it'll create everything at once.
There's 4 types of warnings, the scenarios below cover them.
