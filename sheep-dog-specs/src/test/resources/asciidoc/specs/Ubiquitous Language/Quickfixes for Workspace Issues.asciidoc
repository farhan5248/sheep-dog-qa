= Test-Suite: Quickfixes for Workspace Issues

@sheep-dog-test

Some problems are fixed by code generation.
They're typically things like keywords or objects that are not defined in the step objects layer.
I could just ignore all those warnings and then use the Build Project menu item and it'll create everything at once.
There's 4 types of warnings, the scenarios below cover them.

== Test-Case: This object doesn't exist validation

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows

* And: The xtext plugin validate dialog is set as follows
+
----
The step object file doesn't exist for the component
----

* When: The xtext plugin list quickfixes action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Element Type
| Test Step   
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin list quickfixes dialog will be set as follows
