= Test-Suite: Validation for Workspace Issues

@sheep-dog-test
@Validate

Some problems are fixed by code generation.
They're typically things like keywords or objects that are not defined in the step objects layer.
I could just ignore all those warnings and then use the Build Project menu item and it'll create everything at once.
There's 4 types of warnings, the scenarios below cover them.

== Test-Case: This object doesn't exist validation

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                               
| The daily batchjob Input file is present
|===

* When: The xtext plugin validate action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element                          
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin validate dialog will be set as follows
+
----
The step object file doesn't exist for the component
----

== Test-Case: This object step definition doesn't exist validation

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                               
| The daily batchjob Input file is present
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is absent           
|===

* When: The xtext plugin validate action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element                          
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin validate dialog will be set as follows
+
----
The step definition doesn't exist for the step object
----

== Test-Case: This object step definition parameter set doesn't exist validation

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                       | Headers   
| The daily batchjob Input file is set as follows | New Header
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name | Parameters     
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is set as follows    | Existing Header
|===

* When: The xtext plugin validate action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element                                      
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1/Table/Row/1
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin validate dialog will be set as follows
+
----
The step parameters don't exist for the step definition
----

== Test-Case: This object step definition text parameter doesn't exist validation

Validation should define first what a text parameter table looks like, that is with "Content"
The test should say that if there's a Content column, you get no error.
A second test will state if you don't have a content column, your log an error.

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                       | Text Content
| The daily batchjob Input file is set as follows | New Content 
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name | Parameters     
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is set as follows    | Existing Header
|===

* When: The xtext plugin validate action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element                                
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1/Text/
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin validate dialog will be set as follows
+
----
The step parameters don't exist for the step definition
----
