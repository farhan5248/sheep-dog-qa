= Test-Suite: Grammar Long Names

@sheep-dog-test

There are long-form or qualified names for
1. TestSuite - This is the file name from the asciidoc directory starting from specs.
2. StepObject - This is the file name from the asciidoc directory starting from stepdefs.
3. TestStep - A test step without the StepObject path or component inherits those from previous steps.

== Test-Case: Object path and component is inherited from previous steps

Add more examples of all the combinations for a single object.
Then add examples of how two objects in the same test affect the inheritance.
