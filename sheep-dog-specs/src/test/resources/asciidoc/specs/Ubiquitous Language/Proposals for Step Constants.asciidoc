= Test-Suite: Proposals for Step Constants

@sheep-dog-test

Some parts of the step are constants defined in the regular expression use for validation.
Basically each step has these parts

1. The object: This includes the component and qualified name.
2. The details: This is used to narrow down the statement/predicate (true or false) to a section like a header or trailer record
3. The predicate: This is the part that is supposed to evaluate to true or false if it's an assertion or set a value

TODO Make a test suite for each of the three types above

Those three are further broken down and I probably need better names to describe them but this is the list for now

1. Component types: application, plugin
2. Object types: page, file
3. Modality types: is, isn't, will be, won't be
4. Section types: snippet, section, table
5. Attachment types: with, as follows

== Test-Case: Propose nothing

If the step is complete, there's nothing to suggest.
However if it's an attachment, that means a text or table section should follow.
Those proposals are triggered from the next line.

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                 
| The daily batchjob Input file is present
|===

* When: The xtext plugin propose test step action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin propose content dialog will be empty
