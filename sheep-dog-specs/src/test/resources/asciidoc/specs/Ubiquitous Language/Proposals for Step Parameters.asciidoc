= Test-Suite: Proposals for Step Parameters

@sheep-dog-test

TODO Add text string tests.

If the step definition has step parameters, they'll be proposed.

== Test-Case: No existing step object

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                          
| The daily batchjob Input file is created as follows
|===

* When: The xtext plugin list proposals action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element                                      
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1/Table/Row/1
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin list proposals dialog will be empty

== Test-Case: No existing step definition

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                          
| The daily batchjob Input file is created as follows
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present          
|===

* When: The xtext plugin list proposals action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element                                      
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1/Table/Row/1
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin list proposals dialog will be empty

== Test-Case: Has existing step definition without parameters

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                               
| The daily batchjob Input file is present
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name  | Parameters
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is created as follows | H1        
|===

* When: The xtext plugin list proposals action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Selected Element                                      
| TestSuite/1/TestStepContainer/1/TestStep/1/Table/Row/1
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin list proposals dialog will be empty

== Test-Case: Has existing step definition with parameters

TODO I should add more parameter combinations to describe this better.
