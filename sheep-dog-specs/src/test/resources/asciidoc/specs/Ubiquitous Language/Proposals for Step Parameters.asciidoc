@sheep-dog-test

TODO Add text string tests.

If the step definition has step parameters, they'll be proposed.

== Test-Case: No proposal for absent object

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                           
| The daily batchjob Input file is created as follows
|===

* When: The xtext plugin propose test step table action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin propose dialog will be empty

== Test-Case: No proposal for absent step definition

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows

| Step Name                                           
| The daily batchjob Input file is created as follows
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present          
|===

* When: The xtext plugin propose test step table action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin propose dialog will be empty

== Test-Case: List parameters for a step definition if it exists

TODO I should add more parameter combinations to describe this better.
