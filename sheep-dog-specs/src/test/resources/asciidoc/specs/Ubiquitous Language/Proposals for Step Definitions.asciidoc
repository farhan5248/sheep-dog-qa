= Test-Suite: Proposals for Step Definitions

@sheep-dog-test

Because a step can have a component or not and the full path specified or not, you can have 4 keywords like:

1. The daily batchjob path/to/file/Input file is empty
2. The daily batchjob Input file is empty
3. The path/to/file/Input file is empty
4. The Input file is empty

So instead of saving all combinations, only the details section and predicate are saved.
When the reference look-up is done, the step-object is located using the full path and component.

== Test-Case: Has component no existing step object

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                    
| The daily batchjob Input file
|===

* When: The xtext plugin list proposals action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Element Type
| Row         
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin list proposals dialog will be empty

== Test-Case: Has component no existing step definition

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows

|===
| Step Name                    
| The daily batchjob Input file
|===

* When: The xtext plugin list proposals action is performed as follows
+
|===
| Element Type
| Row         
|===

* Then: The xtext plugin list proposals dialog will be empty

== Test-Case: Has component has existing step definition

* Given: The spec-prj project src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows

| The daily batchjob Input file
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows

|===
| Object Name                       | Step Definition Name | Step Definition Description
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | is present           | Creates empty file         
|===

* When: The xtext plugin list proposals action is performed as follows
