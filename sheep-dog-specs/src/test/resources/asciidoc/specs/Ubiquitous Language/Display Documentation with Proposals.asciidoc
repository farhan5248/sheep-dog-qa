= Test-Suite: Display Documentation with Proposals

@sheep-dog-test

Just as you can see the associated Javadoc for classes and attributes, you can attach documentation about the objects and step-definitions.

== Test-Case: Display Step Object documentation

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name          
| The daily batchjob,
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Object Description
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | Description\n     
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, propose test step action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin, propose content dialog will be set as follows
+
|===
| Suggestion                     | Suggestion Name | Suggestion Description
| The daily batchjob, Input file | Input file      | Description\n         
|===

== Test-Case: Components have no documentation

Right now there's no component asciidoc file in which to describe it, I'll add that later.

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name
| empty    
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Object Description
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | Description       
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, propose test step action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin, propose content dialog will be set as follows
+
|===
| Suggestion          | Suggestion Name | Suggestion Description
| The daily batchjob, | daily batchjob  | daily batchjob        
|===

== Test-Case: Display empty tooltip if there's no documentation

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                
| The daily batchjob, Input file is present
| empty                                    
|===

* And: The src/test/resources/asciidoc/stepdefs/daily batchjob/Input file.asciidoc file is created as follows
+
|===
| Object Name                       | Object Description
| daily batchjob/Input file.feature | empty             
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, propose test step action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin, propose content dialog will be set as follows
+
|===
| Suggestion     | Suggestion Name | Suggestion Description                                
| The Input file | Input file      | Referred in: The daily batchjob, Input file is present
|===

== Test-Case: Display non-existing object references

If an object is mentioned in a test step but isn't created in the stepdefs folder yet, it can still be used.
In that case, the tooltip displays the line that the object is on.

* Given: The spec-prj project, src/test/resources/asciidoc/specs/Process2.asciidoc file steps snippet is created as follows
+
|===
| Step Name                                
| The daily batchjob, Input file is present
| empty                                    
|===

* When: The xtext plugin, propose test step action is performed

* Then: The xtext plugin, propose content dialog will be set as follows
+
|===
| Suggestion     | Suggestion Name | Suggestion Description                                
| The Input file | Input file      | Referred in: The daily batchjob, Input file is present
|===

== Test-Case: Display existing object references

If the fully qualified name of an object is specified, then its documentation is displayed.
If it's a reference to an object in a previous step, the referred object name is displayed.
This is done because it was useful to know to which step the object is implicitly pointing to.

TODO I guess I could put the full name and the documentation if it exists.
