= Language Mapping

These tests in this folder are broken down as follows:

1. Language type, UML and Cucumber (Feature and Java).
2. Direction, reverse engineer into a model or forward engineer from a model.
3. Language element type in the xtext grammar like Test-Suite, Test-Step, Test-Case, etc.
4. Token per type like keyword or equals sign or name.

TODO: Rename Feature, Scenario, Background, DocString and Examples to match the grammar.
